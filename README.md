How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Functionality always comes down to testing and in this assignment I was able to add a form of automated 
testing that checked the inputs before it ran the program. It was important to test sections indivually and 
together to create a well operating system. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

This comes from comunicting well with clients to create an idea of what they want from the product and 
your ability as a developer to inform them of what you can do to achieve these goals for your client. 
This to me also represents the importance of listening to feedback especially from customers to create 
the best possible experience.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by dividing the work into section based on the needs of the client that 
would have already been explained to me and first testing each section individually. When all parts are 
complete I check to ensure that all these sections are still able to work together then present the finished 
project and repeat if necessary based on feedback.
